- How to implement the design pattern Model View Controller (MVC)

## Technologies Used

## Known Limitations

It may not display properly on some devices or displays due to its responsive design. We recommend using a laptop/desktop PC.
Adding projects with '#' and dates with 'dd/mm/yyyy' might not be the most UX friendly
When an user deletes a task, its project is not deleted from the list
